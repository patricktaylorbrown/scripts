Okay, running this script via Group Policy (specifically as a computer startup script) changes some considerations, mainly around execution context and feedback:

Execution Context: Computer startup scripts run as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which has the necessary permissions to enable Windows features. So, you don't need an explicit admin check like #Requires -RunAsAdministrator (which wouldn't work in this context anyway).

"Silent" Operation: Startup scripts are inherently silent from a user's perspective (no console window visible). However, you still want to know if it succeeded, failed, or requires a reboot.

Feedback/Logging: Since there's no interactive console, logging to the Windows Event Log is the standard way to track the script's actions and any errors.

Reboots: The script should definitely use -NoRestart. If a reboot is required, it should log this. You would then typically manage reboots through other GPO settings (like scheduled reboots for updates) or just let users reboot when they normally would. Forcing an immediate reboot from a startup script is generally bad practice.

Idempotency: The script should be safe to run every time the computer starts. Your existing check if ($feature.State -ne "Enabled") handles this well.

Here's a version modified for GPO startup script deployment, with robust event logging:

# Script to enable Windows Sandbox feature via GPO Startup Script
# This script is intended to run as a Computer Startup Script in Group Policy.
# It will run with SYSTEM privileges.

$featureName = "Containers-DisposableClientVM"
$eventSource = "WindowsSandboxInstallScript" # Custom event source
$logName = "Application" # Or "System" or a custom log

# --- Function to write to Event Log ---
function Write-LogEntry {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Message,

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [ValidateSet("Information", "Warning", "Error")]
        [string]$EntryType = "Information",

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [int]$EventId = 1000 # Default Event ID
    )

    # Check if the event source exists, create if not (requires admin, which SYSTEM has)
    if (-not ([System.Diagnostics.EventLog]::SourceExists($eventSource))) {
        try {
            New-EventLog -LogName $logName -Source $eventSource -ErrorAction Stop
        }
        catch {
            # If creating the source fails, write to a generic PowerShell source (less ideal)
            Write-Warning "Failed to create event source '$eventSource'. Logging to 'PowerShell' source. Error: $($_.Exception.Message)"
            $altSource = "PowerShell" # Fallback source
            # Note: This fallback might not always work perfectly if the PowerShell source itself isn't registered for the chosen log.
            # However, for Information/Warning, it's often fine. Errors might be more problematic.
            # It's best if $eventSource creation succeeds.
            try {
                Write-EventLog -LogName $logName -Source $altSource -EventId $EventId -EntryType $EntryType -Message $Message -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
            } catch {
                # If even fallback fails, there's not much more to do silently.
                # This usually means a fundamental issue with event logging service or permissions for that specific source/log.

How to Deploy with GPO:

Save the Script: Save the PowerShell script above as, for example, Enable-WindowsSandbox.ps1.

Place in a Shared Location:

The most common practice is to place it in the GPO's own script storage, which automatically replicates to domain controllers. When you add a startup script via the GPO editor, it will offer to copy the script into:
\\<YOUR_DOMAIN>\SysVol\<YOUR_DOMAIN>\Policies\<PolicyGUID>\Machine\Scripts\Startup

Alternatively, you can place it on a network share accessible by Domain Computers (with Read & Execute permissions), like NETLOGON. However, using the GPO's built-in storage is generally preferred for startup/shutdown scripts.

Create or Edit a GPO:

Open Group Policy Management (gpmc.msc).

Create a new GPO and link it to an OU containing the computer accounts you want to target, or edit an existing GPO.

Configure the Startup Script:

Navigate to: Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Scripts (Startup/Shutdown).

Double-click on Startup in the right-hand pane.

In the Startup Properties dialog, click the PowerShell Scripts tab.

Important: If you only see Scripts and not PowerShell Scripts, it means your management station or the GPO functional level might be older. In that case, you'd use the Scripts tab and might have to call powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <PathToScript>. However, the PowerShell Scripts tab is the modern and preferred way.

Click Add....

Click Browse... and navigate to where you saved Enable-WindowsSandbox.ps1. If you are using the GPO's internal storage, GPMC will offer to copy it there. Select your script.

You can leave Script Parameters blank.

Click OK twice.

Wait for GPO Propagation:

Clients will apply the GPO at their next startup after the GPO has replicated and they have updated their policy (or after a gpupdate /force followed by a reboot).

Event Log IDs Used in this Script:

Information:

1001: Script started checking feature status.

1002: Feature already enabled.

1003: Attempting to enable the feature.

1004: Feature enabled successfully, no reboot needed.

Warning:

2000: Feature enabled, but a reboot is required.

Error:

3000: An error occurred during script execution.

Checking the Event Log:

After deployment and a client computer reboot, you can check the Application Event Log (or whichever log you configured in $logName) on a target machine for entries from the source WindowsSandboxInstallScript (or $eventSource).

This approach provides robust, silent deployment and good administrative feedback through event logging.
